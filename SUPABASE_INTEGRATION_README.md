- Feedback and rating systems

### 🏗️ New Service Architecture

#### Core Services Created:
1. **`profileService.ts`** - User profile management, skills, certificates, education
2. **`jobService.ts`** - Job posting, searching, application management
3. **`courseService.ts`** - Course creation, enrollment, progress tracking
4. **`notificationService.ts`** - Real-time notifications with Supabase realtime
5. **`activityService.ts`** - User activity tracking and analytics
6. **`blogService.ts`** - Blog post management and publishing
7. **`discussionService.ts`** - Community forum functionality
8. **`feedbackService.ts`** - Rating and feedback system

#### Database Integration:
- **`database.ts`** - Complete TypeScript type definitions
- **`schema.sql`** - Full PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies
- **Fixed environment configuration** - Corrected Supabase URL typos

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
VITE_APP_NAME=GLOSHEN
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### 2. Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the `database/schema.sql` file in your Supabase SQL editor
3. Enable the required policies and triggers

### 3. Authentication Setup

The system uses Supabase Auth with automatic profile creation:
- Users are automatically added to the `profiles` table upon registration
- Profile completeness is tracked and updated automatically
- Row Level Security ensures data privacy

### 4. Real-time Features

The following features use Supabase real-time:
- Live notifications
- Activity feeds
- Discussion updates
- Real-time collaboration features

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### `profiles`
- Extends Supabase auth.users
- Stores user profile information
- Links to all user-related data

#### `skills`, `certificates`, `education`, `experience`
- User profile components
- Linked to profiles with cascade delete
- Public viewing with owner-only editing

#### `jobs`, `courses`, `enrollments`
- Job board and educational platform
- Full CRUD operations with proper permissions
- Search and filtering capabilities

#### `notifications`, `activities`
- Real-time notifications system
- Activity tracking for analytics

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Components

1. **Replace mock data imports** with service imports
2. **Update state management** to use async operations
3. **Add loading and error states** for better UX
4. **Implement real-time subscriptions** where needed

### Example Migration:

```typescript
// Before (mock data)
const mockJobs = [/* ... */]

// After (real data)
import { jobService } from '../services/jobService'

const [jobs, setJobs] = useState([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchJobs = async () => {
    const data = await jobService.getActiveJobs()
    setJobs(data)
    setLoading(false)
  }
  fetchJobs()
}, [])
```

## Performance Optimizations

- **Database indexes** on frequently queried columns
- **Pagination support** in all list operations
- **Caching strategies** for static data
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Batch operations** for bulk actions

## Error Handling

All services include comprehensive error handling:
- Network failure recovery
- Authentication state management
- Validation error reporting
- User-friendly error messages

## Real-time Subscriptions

Example of setting up real-time notifications:

```typescript
import { notificationService } from '../services/notificationService'

useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) return

  const subscription = notificationService.subscribeToNotifications(
    user.id,
    (notification) => {
      // Handle new notification
      showNotification(notification)
    }
  )

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe()
  }
}, [user])
```

## Next Steps

1. **Set up your Supabase project** with the provided schema
2. **Configure environment variables** 
3. **Test the authentication flow**
4. **Verify data operations** work correctly
5. **Set up real-time subscriptions** for live features
6. **Configure file storage** for profile pictures and attachments
7. **Set up analytics** and monitoring
8. **Deploy to production** with proper environment configuration

## Support

For questions or issues with the Supabase integration:
1. Check the Supabase documentation
2. Review the service implementations
3. Verify your environment configuration
4. Check the database schema and policies

This refactor provides a solid foundation for a production-ready application with real data, proper security, and scalable architecture.
