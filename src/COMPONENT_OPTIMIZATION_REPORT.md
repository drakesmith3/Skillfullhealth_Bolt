## Performance Metrics & Benefits

### Code Size Reduction
| Component | Original Lines | Optimized Lines | Reduction |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Features | 174 | 276 | +59% (functionality added) |
| AnimatedBook | 222 | 285 | +28% (features added) |
| HowItWorksWheel | 1,688 | ~400 | -76% |
| **Total** | **2,084** | **961** | **-54%** |

### Performance Improvements
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory leaks through proper cleanup
- **Rendering Performance**: Memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Animation Performance**: RAF-based animations for 60fps consistency
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized for touch devices and smaller screens
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance improvements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Optimization Patterns Used

1. **Memoization Strategy**:
   ```typescript
   const memoizedStyles = useMemo(() => ({
     // Expensive style calculations
   }), [dependencies]);
   
   const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
     // Event handler logic
   }, [dependencies]);
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   ```typescript
   const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(true);
   
   useEffect(() => {
     return () => setIsMounted(false);
   }, []);
   ```

3. **Throttled Event Handling**:
   ```typescript
   const throttledHandler = useCallback(() => {
     if (timeoutRef.current) clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current);
     timeoutRef.current = setTimeout(actualHandler, delay);
   }, [dependencies]);
   ```

4. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   ```typescript
   <section role="region" aria-label="Component Description">
     <h2 id="heading-id">Title</h2>
     <div aria-labelledby="heading-id">Content</div>
   </section>
   ```
